## ___There are 5 options for a hands-on Embedded sysstems experience, suggested by Dr. Sam Siewart.___

1. Using a Raspberry Pi 3b+ or newer models. (Reccomeneded by the teacher)

2. NVIDIA Jetson Nano. (more powerful)

3. A VirtualBox with Ubuntu LTS (won't help to complete some assignments involving cameras and hardware-software interfacing)

4. A laptop running Linux (bare metal installations) (will work well, but discouraged since this isn't an embedded system per se).

5. Intel NUC with Ubuntu LTS

But, we'll MSYS2, because why not? And Raspberry Pi's fucking expensive out here :(
